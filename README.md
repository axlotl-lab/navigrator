# @axlotl-lab/navigrator

A powerful local domain manager for development environments. Navigrator helps you manage local domains and SSL certificates with a simple web interface.

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@axlotl-lab/navigrator.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@axlotl-lab/navigrator)

## Features

- Easily manage local domains (`*.local`, etc.)
- Create and manage SSL certificates for local development
- Simple web interface for domain management
- Enable/disable domains without removing them
- Automatic SSL certificate generation
- Import existing host entries

## Requirements

- Node.js 14 or newer
- OpenSSL installed and available in PATH
- Administrator/sudo privileges (for modifying the hosts file)

## Installation

### Installing OpenSSL

Before installing Navigrator, make sure OpenSSL is installed on your system:

**Windows:**
1. Download the installer from [https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html)
2. Run the installer and select "Copy OpenSSL DLLs to Windows system directory"
3. Restart your terminal/command prompt

**macOS:**
```bash
# Using Homebrew
brew install openssl
```

**Linux:**
```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install openssl

# Fedora/RHEL
sudo dnf install openssl
```

### Installing Navigrator

You can install Navigrator globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g @axlotl-lab/navigrator
```

## Usage

### Starting the web interface

```bash
navigrator start
```

This will start the web interface on port 10191 by default and open it in your browser.

**Note:** Since Navigrator modifies your hosts file, it requires administrator/sudo privileges to run.

- Windows: Run Command Prompt or PowerShell as Administrator
- macOS/Linux: Use sudo

```bash
# On macOS/Linux
sudo navigrator start
```

### Options

```bash
# Start on a different port
navigrator start --port 4000

# Specify a different SSL port
navigrator start --ssl-port 3443
```

### Command Line Interface

In addition to the web interface, you can use Navigrator from the command line:

```bash
# List all local domains
navigrator list

# Add a new domain
navigrator add myapp.local

# Add a domain with a specific IP
navigrator add myapp.local --ip 127.0.0.2

# Remove a domain
navigrator remove myapp.local
```

## Web Interface

The web interface provides a user-friendly way to manage your local domains:

- **Domains Tab**: Manage all your local domains
  - Add new domains
  - Enable/disable existing domains
  - Import existing domains from hosts file
  - Remove domains when no longer needed
  - View certificate status for each domain

- **Certificates Tab**: Manage SSL certificates
  - View all generated certificates
  - Check certificate status and expiration dates
  - Refresh certificates
  - Delete individual certificates

## How It Works

Navigrator manages entries in your system's hosts file and generates SSL certificates for local development. It uses:

- Node.js for the backend server
- React for the web interface
- OpenSSL for certificate generation
- A local Certificate Authority (CA) for signing certificates

The first time you run Navigrator, it creates a local Certificate Authority (CA) in your home directory. This CA is used to sign certificates for your local domains, making them trusted by your browser after installing the CA certificate.

## Certificate Trust

For browsers to trust the certificates generated by Navigrator, you need to install the local CA certificate:

**The CA certificate is located at:**
```
~/.navigrator/certs/ca/rootCA.crt
```

**Installing the CA certificate:**

**Windows:**
1. Double-click the CA certificate file
2. Select "Local Machine" and click Next
3. Select "Place all certificates in the following store"
4. Click "Browse" and select "Trusted Root Certification Authorities"
5. Complete the wizard

**macOS:**
1. Double-click the CA certificate file
2. Add it to your login keychain
3. Open Keychain Access
4. Find the certificate (Navigrator Local CA)
5. Double-click it and set "Trust" to "Always Trust"

**Linux (Chrome/Chromium):**
```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo cp ~/.navigrator/certs/ca/rootCA.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
sudo update-ca-certificates

# Fedora/RHEL
sudo cp ~/.navigrator/certs/ca/rootCA.crt /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/
sudo update-ca-trust
```

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Issues

If you see errors related to permission denied:

- Make sure you're running Navigrator with administrator privileges
- On macOS/Linux, use `sudo navigrator start`
- On Windows, run Command Prompt or PowerShell as Administrator

### OpenSSL Not Found

If you get an error about OpenSSL not being installed:

1. Install OpenSSL following the instructions in the Installation section
2. Make sure OpenSSL is available in your PATH
3. Try running `openssl version` in your terminal to verify it's working

### Certificate Not Trusted

If your browser shows certificate warnings:

1. Make sure you've installed the CA certificate as described in the "Certificate Trust" section
2. Restart your browser after installing the CA certificate
3. If using Chrome, you might need to visit `chrome://restart` after installing the CA

## Publishing New Versions

1. Update the version in `package.json`:
   ```json
   "version": "1.0.1",
   ```

2. Test the package locally before publishing:
   ```bash
   # Create a local package
   npm pack
   
   # Install the package globally to test it
   npm install -g ./axlotl-lab-navigrator-1.0.0.tgz
   
   # Test that it works properly
   navigrator start
   ```

3. Create a git tag for the new version:
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.1
   ```

4. Push the tag to the repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin v1.0.1
   ```

5. Publish to npm:
   ```bash
   npm publish
   ```
